Diiference b/w First level and Second level caches:-
===================================================
 Here's a table summarizing the key differences between the first-level cache (Session cache) and the second-level cache in Hibernate:
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
| Feature                | First-Level Cache (Session Cache)                           | Second-Level Cache                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Scope                  | Limited to a single Hibernate Session                       | Shared across multiple Hibernate Sessions        |
| Relationship to Session| Associated with a specific Session within a Session Factory | Associated with the entire Session Factory       |
| Factory                |                                                             |                                                  |
| Data Storage           | Entity instances and associated data                        | Entities, query results, and arbitrary objects   |
| Cache Level            | Transaction-scoped                                          | Session Factory-scoped                           |
| Caching Granularity    | Entity-level granularity                                    | Configurable caching strategies                  |
| Lifespan               | Cleared when the Session is closed or cleared explicitly    | Persists beyond the lifespan of a single session |
| Cache Provider         | Built-in within Hibernate framework                         | Configurable with various cache providers        |
| Configuration          | No explicit configuration required (enabled by default)     | Requires explicit configuration and setup        |
| Query Result Caching   | Not supported                                               | Supported via separate Query Cache               |
