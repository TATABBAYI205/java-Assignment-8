Session in Hibernate:-
=====================
A Session is used to get a physical connection with a database. The Session object is lightweight and designed to be instantiated each time an interaction is needed with the database. Persistent objects are saved and retrieved through a Session object.

The session objects should not be kept open for a long time because they are not usually thread safe and they should be created and destroyed them as needed. The main function of the Session is to offer, create, read, and delete operations for instances of mapped entity classes.

Instances may exist in one of the following three states at a given point in time 

-> transient:A new instance of a persistent class, which is not associated with a Session and has no representation in the database and no 
   identifier value is considered transient by Hibernate.

-> persistentYou can make a transient instance persistent by associating it with a Session. A persistent instance has a representation in 
   the database, an identifier value and is associated with a Session.

-> detached âˆ’ Once we close the Hibernate Session, the persistent instance will become a detached instance.
