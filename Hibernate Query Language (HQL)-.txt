Hibernate Query Language (HQL):-
==============================
-> Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is an object-oriented query language, similar to SQL, but instead of operating on tables and columns, HQL  
   works with persistent objects and their properties. HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL queries, which in turns 
   perform action on database.

-> Although you can use SQL statements directly with Hibernate using Native SQL, but I would recommend to use HQL whenever possible to avoid  
   database portability hassles, and to take advantage of Hibernate's SQL generation and caching strategies.

-> Keywords like SELECT, FROM, and WHERE, etc., are not case sensitive, but properties like table and column names are case sensitive in
   HQL.
