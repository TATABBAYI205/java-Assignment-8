Advantages of using Hibernate ORM Framework:-
==========================================

-> Simplifies Database Operations: Hibernate ORM simplifies database operations by providing an easy-to-use API for storing and retrieving 
   data from the database. This reduces the amount of boilerplate code required to interact with the database.

-> Improves Performance: Hibernate ORM provides support for caching, which improves application performance by reducing the number of 
   database queries. It caches frequently accessed data in memory, which reduces the time taken to access the data from the database.

-> Platform Independence: Hibernate ORM is platform-independent, which means it can be used with any relational database. This provides 
   flexibility and makes it easy to switch databases without changing the code.

-> Open-Source: Hibernate ORM is an open-source framework, which means it is freely available and can be used by anyone. This reduces the 
   cost of development and makes it easy to get started with Hibernate ORM.
